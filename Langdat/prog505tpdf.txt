Program 505T
(cows and horses)

Program Description:
Read from the data file,
the first number of the data file will
represent the number of hay bales the farm
currently has. It is followed by the cost of
each hay bale.

The next number is the number of corncobs the
farm has, followed by the cost of each corncob.
The data file will then provide the number of
cows that are stored in the data file.  Each
cow has a weight, followed by pounds of milk
produced per day, followed by the number of
hay bales eaten each day per cow, followed by
a number of corncobs eaten each day per cow.

The next set of data will have an int for the
number of horses.  Their weight comes next.
This will be followed by the number of hay
bales eaten each day, followed by the number
of corncobs eaten each day, followed by the
number of rides that horse gave and the cost
per ride for that horse.

Complete the farm, horse and cow classes -
be sure to create constructors for each of
the classes.
